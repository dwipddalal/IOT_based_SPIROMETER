# IOT_based_SPIROMETER
## What is Spirometer
Spirometry is the most popular test for determining 
whether or not the lungs are working properly. It is 
used to diagnose a variety of lung conditions such 
as asthma and Common Obtrusive Lung Disorder 
(COPD). One of the most common uses of this test is 
to determine the patient's lung capacity. It is a very 
useful test since it allows the doctor to determine the 
patient's breathing rate, which then can be used to 
determine correct diagnosis that should be provided 
to the patient. This test may also be prescribed by a 
doctor in response to symptoms such as cough, 
wheezing, or bronchitis. Spirometry not only 
improves the diagnosis of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, but it also improves the 
management of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease. </br>
An instrument called a spirometer is used to perform 
a spirometry test. The initial step is to blow air 
through a blow pipe or a hole in the spirometer. The 
device then uses the rate of air blown to measure 
lung parameters to provide an overall report on 
lung health. 

## Model
We aim to create a workable 
prototype of a low-cost spirometer that can be used 
for routine respiratory health checks at home as part 
of this project. The model calculates the rate of air 
expelled in terms of impeller rpm, which can be used 
to calculate lung capacity. This approach can also be 
tweaked to directly evaluate lung capacity.
